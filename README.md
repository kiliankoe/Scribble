# Scribble

**This is WIP and is neither functional nor usable at the current time. Please check back later ðŸ‘‹**

I pretty much only use iTunes to listen to music nowadays. I kinda miss scrobbling though. And as I remember it the official Last.fm client is way too bloated.

This aims to a minimalistic menu bar app doing nothing but scrobble your current iTunes tracks. It will have to be running unfortunately, but it's very lightweight!
